# Welcome to Admiral Aokiji's profile 🦊👀

### Hi, I'm Rohit 🤝

I'm a lazy, introverted😴 bum who is passionate about creating projects related to my interests and/or increases my productivity. 

Most of my projects here are solutions I developed for the problems encountered by people around me♻️. Most of the projects are incomplete - half because of my compulsive nature for incorporating intricate details and innovative features👁️‍🗨️ in my projects, while the rest are incomplete because I easily get distracted by new projects and technologies. My ultimate desire has always been to develop __my own desktop GUI app__, which led me to create <a href="https://github.com/admiral-aokiji">Butler</a> 🤩, a platform for some small, menial tasks like PDF editing, password encryption and maintaining a database for all local and online study resources.

__NOTE:__ I suck at naming my projects and repositories, so please read the README files. 😁

I am proficient in __Python, SQL, JavaScript and NodeJS__. I have __strong expertise in data engineering and data visualization__ 🎈, and have my hands set on tools like __PowerBI, AWS, Google Data Studio, Google Analytics and Streamlit__ . Some technologies I enjoy working with include __ReactJS, MongoDB and QTCreator__. I love __web scraping__ and __exploring new Python packages__ ✨. I have __intermediate knowledge of basic supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms__ and am currently exploring handling big data. 

I am looking forward to working as a __analyst__ in the future (data, product or sports analyst to be precise), and have recently completed a data engineering internship. So please give a look at my repos and share your reviews.🙌
