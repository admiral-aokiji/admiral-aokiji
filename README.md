# Welcome to Admiral Aokiji's profile 🦊👀

### Hi, I'm Rohit 🤝

I'm a lazy, introverted😴 bum who is passionate about creating anything which piques my interests and/or increases my productivity. 

I have always wanted to create something that would help the people around me and myself somehow.✌️ Hence, most of my projects are solutions developed to the problems encountered by people around me by sifting the web♻️. Half of them here are incomplete because of my compulsive striving for incorporating intricate details and innovative features👁️‍🗨️ in my projects. Meanwhile, the other half of them are also incomplete because I easily get distracted by new projects and technologies. Also, I suck at naming my projects and repositories, so please read the README files. 😁

I am proficient in __Python, JavaScript, NodeJS and SQL__. I have __strong expertise in data exploration and data visualization__ 🎈, using tools like __Tableau, PowerBI, Streamlit__ and packages like __pandas__ and __seaborn__. Some technologies I enjoy working with include __ReactJS, MongoDB and QTCreator__. I love __web scraping__ and exploring new Python packages ✨. I have __intermediate knowledge of basic supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms__ and am currently learning deep learning. My ultimate desire was to develop __my own desktop GUI app__, which led me to create <a href="https://github.com/admiral-aokiji">Butler</a> 🤩, a platform for some small, menial tasks like PDF editing, password encryption and maintaining a database for all local and online study resources.

I am looking forward to working as a __business analyst__ in the future, but I have no industrial experience in this field. So please give a look at my repos and share your reviews.🙌
